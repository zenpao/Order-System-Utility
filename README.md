It is fair to give warning upon code manipulation. MODIFY AT YOUR OWN RISK. Source codes and resources are by-product of intensive research and any familiar methodologies are owned by their respective authors/owners. This product includes software developed by Java.

SIDE NOTE: Only run within the root folder e.g (C:\ , D:, etc.). Do not place within root folder sub directories which asks special permissions e.g (Program Files, Program Files(x86), etc.). The solution was made with NetBeans 8.1 IDE. The application can be run with its .EXE shortcut, hence, if lost, navigate to the app_OrderEnv folder\dist\app_OrderEnv.jar .

Thank you for using ORX.
